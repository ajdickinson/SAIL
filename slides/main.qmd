## What is economics?

> The study of scarcity, the study of how people use resources and respond to incentives, or the study of decision-making

<br>

. . .

I think of economics as a [perspective]{.hi}. [_How do we make the best decisions with what we have?_]{.fragment}

. . .

<br>

Think about the constraints that limit us from getting everything we want

<!-- This perspective can be used in a variety of contexts:

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Scarcity and choice
- Opportunity cost
- Marginal thinking
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Markets and prices as coordinators
- Market failures
- The role of government
:::

::::

We want to share our story through an economist's perspective -->

## What does an economist do?

. . .

Study how societies [allocate their limited resources]{.hi} to meet their needs and wants

. . .

<br>

Economist work in a wide variety of context to best allocate resources

:::: {.columns}

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Macroeconomic forecasting
- Policy analysis
- Trade
- Health choices
:::

::: {.column width="50%"}
- Financial sector
- Taxation
- Environmental management
- Education
:::

::::

::: {.notes}
Should we increase interest rates?
What fiscal policy can we use to help the economy to recover from COVID?
How can we reduce the health costs of air pollution?
What is the most efficient tax system?
:::

. . .

With this in mind, how might an economist think about the decision to go to college or graduate school?
