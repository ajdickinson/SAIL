I finished high school there and then did two years of college at Universidad de Costa Rica before flunking out

[Oregon]{.hi}

## My Path to Here

[University of Oregon]{.hii}

. . .

- I actually applied to a lot of schools and UO was not my first choice
  - I still have my rejection letter from Pitt somewhere

. . .

- That said, UO has been a great match for me
  - I have great friends, great opportunities and great mentors to help me through it all
  
- But most importantly, I have enjoy myself and have a great sense of accomplishment from all that I have done and am about to do

## Why Did I Go To College?

I like learning, competing, and contributing to my community

In my mind, a college degree is the most direct way to put myself in a position to accomplish all those things

. . .

[Why Graduate School?]{.hi}

It is how I can accomplish my career goals of teaching and conducting research
